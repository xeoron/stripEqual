# stripEqual
 Strip the equal sign out of files in csv files by installing this script system wide.
 This is faster than typing a 1 liner or using a editor.

 Use this script locally, install it system wide, or on macOS use it with Automator so it can run a task on a folder

 Local Usage: ./stripEqual.pl ./Taglisting.csv > ./results.csv
 
 System wide Usage: stripEqual ./Taglisting.csv > ./results.csv
